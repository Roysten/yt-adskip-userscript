# [Hummingbird MAL Rating](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/5890-hummingbird-mal-rating)

Shows the My Anime List community rating in Hummingbird.me

Unfortunately because of how hummingbird.me uses https and myanimelist uses 
http exclusively in order for this script to work you have to allow it to load 
(in chrome a little shield appears at the far right of the url bar and you have 
to click that for the script to run, allowing it to run a script on https).
